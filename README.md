# Project Overview

This project, created by TuanTNT19, focuses on controlling the lighting of LEDs using various peripherals such as ADC, DMA, PWM, and UART. The implementation is optimized with FreeRTOS to enhance program efficiency.

## Branch Structure

- **main**: Default branch, includes this README file.
- **master**: Represents the newest version of the program.
- **Release 1.0**: Initial version utilizing registers to control LEDs and sending data via UART.
- **Release 2.0**: Upgraded from Release 1.0, incorporating FreeRTOS for optimization.
- **Release 3.0**: Further enhanced from Release 2.0, organizing the program into a library for easier management.
